# Blupimania Legacy

## Smaky

For the original Blupimania sources for Smaky, just select the [Git TAG v1.5.0
in the blupimania repository][2]. Maybe in the futur, I will add a more complete
Smaky dump in this repository with Makefile, etc. used to build with a Smaky
computer.

## MS-DOS

In the repository, you will find the last known sources which were used to build
Blupimania for MS-DOS. If you want to hack in the Blupimania sources, it's
better (and very recommanded) to use the sources provided in [the current
officially supported repository][1] instead of this one.

Some sources here are not coming from Epsitec SA then the GPL license cannot be
applied (see in the source files). Everything else must be considered as GPL
(artistic files too), see the LICENSE file here.

This project is using Turbo C and it's possible that it's referencing files that
are out of this scope. This code is provided mostly for history and studying
purposes but not for compiling the game for MS-DOS (even if it should be
possible with some (a lot?) effort to retrieve the environement, compiler,
headers, ...).
